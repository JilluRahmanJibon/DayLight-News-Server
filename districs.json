After Sunday, Dhaka has retained the first place in the list of the polluted cities with an air quality index (AQI) of 293 at 8.00 am Monday. Earlier, Dhaka was at the top of the list on Saturday as well. With this, Dhaka has been at the top position of the list for three consecutive days. Earlier, Dhaka topped the list several times in the last week of December and this year from the beginning of January. International technology company ‘IQ AIR’, specialised in monitoring the air quality, publishes this list regularly. With an AQI score of 291 and 216, Uzbekistan’s Tashkent and New Delhi of India have come out second and third in this list respectively today. Dhaka, Tashkent and New Delhi are followed by Vietnam's Hanoi (189) in AQI score. Then there are three Chinese cities in the list - Wuhan (173), Chongqing (171) and Chengdu (170). The AQI score, prepared based on the daily air quality, indicates quality or pollution of the air in a specific city and informs about any possible health hazard due to air pollution. An AQI between 100 and 200 is said to be ‘unhealthy’ while 201 and 300 is considered ‘very unhealthy’, and 301 to 400 is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents.The children, elderly people and the sick ones are suggested to remain at home and others are requested to limit their outdoor activities.

		"description": "Although the discourse over the recent visit of the US assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu to Bangladesh has not ended yet, certain things should not go unnoticed. Donald Lu arrived in Bangladesh on a two-day visit on 14 January and held meetings with foreign minister AK Abdul Momen, foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen and members of the civil society.  The US official said he had positive discussions with the government high-ups.  The government side echoed the same. After meeting foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and foreign minister Masud Bin Momen, Donald Lu told newsmen, If you notice the statement of Human Rights Watch, you will see it has admitted the extraordinary progress of RAB in decreasing extrajudicial killings. We also recognise this progress. It is extraordinary. It proves RAB is doing well in protecting human rights by maintaining law and order and tackling terrorism. On 10 December 2021, the US imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and its officials on charges of gross human rights violations.  Referring to the meeting with Donald Lu, home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Donald Lu indicated that the sanctions would be lifted shortly. “We think and hope the sanctions will be removed very soon,” the home minister said. Immediately after the home minister's statement, on 17 January, the US embassy made it clear that US assistant secretary Donald Lu did not indicate any timeframe for revoking the sanctions on Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). During his meetings in Dhaka, assistant secretary Lu did not indicate a timeframe for the removal of RAB sanctions,” said the spokesman for the US mission in Dhaka, Jeff Ridenour, on Tuesday. Soon after the issuance of the US embassy's statement, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir at a press conference on Wednesday said the statement the US embassy issued on Tuesday night is enough to explain the visit of the US assistant secretary Donald Lu to Bangladesh. If we look closely at the statements of the ruling Awami League-led government and the main opposition BNP, it seems both the camps are apparently happy over the recent visit of Donald Lu. "

		"description": "Bipul Chakma, a youth from Khagrachhari started a mango orchard on a five-acre plot of hilly land in 2017. Spending Tk 75,000, he planted 500 saplings of Amrapali mango there. They bore fruit after just two years. Initially, he sold mangoes worth Tk 100 thousand. Now, his average sales every month is about Tk 500 to 600 thousand. After graduation, Bipul Chakma took up fruit cultivation instead of waiting to find a job. He runs a fruit business as well. Small-scale gricultural initiatives like Bipul’s, is turning the three hill districts -- Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari -- into a fruit hub. About 38 thousand small and large-scale entrepreneurs are now involved in fruit farming in these three districts. And now 44 different types of fruit including mango, banana, jackfruit, papaya, pineapple and oranges are being grown in the hill tracts. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), about 15 per cent of the total fruit produced across the country comes from these three hill tract districts now. Fruits grown on the hills are now available in different districts across the country including Dhaka and Chattogram. Fruit farmers, agriculturists, businessmen and common consumers of these three districts believe, fruit farming in Chittagong Hill Tracts is increasing due to political stability, switching to permanent orchards from Jhum cultivation, with modern agro-technology and marketing becoming easier than before. Besides, as educated and enthusiastic youths have entered this sector, new entrepreneurs have been created too. Even two decades back, fruits were not commercially grown on the hills. The establishment of commercial fruit orchards started mainly from 2004. Gradually, the number of fruit orchards continued to increase. Hilly areas started coming under fruit farming as well."

		"description": "Although the discourse over the recent visit of the US assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu to Bangladesh has not ended yet, certain things should not go unnoticed. Donald Lu arrived in Bangladesh on a two-day visit on 14 January and held meetings with foreign minister AK Abdul Momen, foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen and members of the civil society.  The US official said he had positive discussions with the government high-ups.  The government side echoed the same. After meeting foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and foreign minister Masud Bin Momen, Donald Lu told newsmen, If you notice the statement of Human Rights Watch, you will see it has admitted the extraordinary progress of RAB in decreasing extrajudicial killings. We also recognise this progress. It is extraordinary. It proves RAB is doing well in protecting human rights by maintaining law and order and tackling terrorism. On 10 December 2021, the US imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and its officials on charges of gross human rights violations.  Referring to the meeting with Donald Lu, home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Donald Lu indicated that the sanctions would be lifted shortly. “We think and hope the sanctions will be removed very soon,” the home minister said. Immediately after the home minister's statement, on 17 January, the US embassy made it clear that US assistant secretary Donald Lu did not indicate any timeframe for revoking the sanctions on Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). During his meetings in Dhaka, assistant secretary Lu did not indicate a timeframe for the removal of RAB sanctions,” said the spokesman for the US mission in Dhaka, Jeff Ridenour, on Tuesday. Soon after the issuance of the US embassy's statement, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir at a press conference on Wednesday said the statement the US embassy issued on Tuesday night is enough to explain the visit of the US assistant secretary Donald Lu to Bangladesh. If we look closely at the statements of the ruling Awami League-led government and the main opposition BNP, it seems both the camps are apparently happy over the recent visit of Donald Lu. "

Pori delivered four healthy cubs weighing between 800-900 grams each around Saturday evening at Chittagong Zoo, said Shahadat Hossain Shuvo, deputy curator of the zoo. With this the total number of tigers in Chittagong Zoo has reached 16 now, he said. Earlier, on 19 July, 2018, Royal Bengal Tiger couple - Raj and Pori - had given birth to the country’s first white tiger cub that was named ‘Shubhra’. “The cubs are drinking their mother’s milk and living with her inside the cage. Within seven days their sex can be identified,” said Shahadat Hossain Shuvo. The white tiger or bleached tiger is a leucistic pigmentation variant of the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger and hybrids between the two. For a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births.

		"description": "Bipul Chakma, a youth from Khagrachhari started a mango orchard on a five-acre plot of hilly land in 2017. Spending Tk 75,000, he planted 500 saplings of Amrapali mango there. They bore fruit after just two years. Initially, he sold mangoes worth Tk 100 thousand. Now, his average sales every month is about Tk 500 to 600 thousand. After graduation, Bipul Chakma took up fruit cultivation instead of waiting to find a job. He runs a fruit business as well. Small-scale gricultural initiatives like Bipul’s, is turning the three hill districts -- Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari -- into a fruit hub. About 38 thousand small and large-scale entrepreneurs are now involved in fruit farming in these three districts. And now 44 different types of fruit including mango, banana, jackfruit, papaya, pineapple and oranges are being grown in the hill tracts. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), about 15 per cent of the total fruit produced across the country comes from these three hill tract districts now. Fruits grown on the hills are now available in different districts across the country including Dhaka and Chattogram. Fruit farmers, agriculturists, businessmen and common consumers of these three districts believe, fruit farming in Chittagong Hill Tracts is increasing due to political stability, switching to permanent orchards from Jhum cultivation, with modern agro-technology and marketing becoming easier than before. Besides, as educated and enthusiastic youths have entered this sector, new entrepreneurs have been created too. Even two decades back, fruits were not commercially grown on the hills. The establishment of commercial fruit orchards started mainly from 2004. Gradually, the number of fruit orchards continued to increase. Hilly areas started coming under fruit farming as well."

An AQI between 151 and 200 is said to be ‘unhealthy’ while 201 and 300 is considered ‘very unhealthy’, and 301 to 400 is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. India’s Delhi and China’s Shenyang occupied the second and third spots in the list, with AQI scores of 313 and 245, respectively. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants—Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognised as increasing a person’s chances of developing a heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections and cancer, according to several studies. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections."

		"description": "After giving birth to the country’s first rare white tiger cub, tiger couple Raj and Pori have now given birth to four more white cubs, reports news agency UNB. Pori delivered four healthy cubs weighing between 800-900 grams each around Saturday evening at Chittagong Zoo, said Shahadat Hossain Shuvo, deputy curator of the zoo. With this the total number of tigers in Chittagong Zoo has reached 16 now, he said. Earlier, on 19 July, 2018, Royal Bengal Tiger couple - Raj and Pori - had given birth to the country’s first white tiger cub that was named ‘Shubhra’. “The cubs are drinking their mother’s milk and living with her inside the cage. Within seven days their sex can be identified,” said Shahadat Hossain Shuvo. The white tiger or bleached tiger is a leucistic pigmentation variant of the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger and hybrids between the two. For a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births. Dark-striped white tigers are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (Panthera tigris) as well as have been reported in several other subspecies first white tiger cub that was named ‘Shubhra’. “The cubs are drinking their mother’s milk and living with her inside the cage.

		"description": "Bipul Chakma, a youth from Khagrachhari started a mango orchard on a five-acre plot of hilly land in 2017. Spending Tk 75,000, he planted 500 saplings of Amrapali mango there. They bore fruit after just two years. Initially, he sold mangoes worth Tk 100 thousand. Now, his average sales every month is about Tk 500 to 600 thousand. After graduation, Bipul Chakma took up fruit cultivation instead of waiting to find a job. He runs a fruit business as well. Small-scale gricultural initiatives like Bipul’s, is turning the three hill districts -- Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari -- into a fruit hub. About 38 thousand small and large-scale entrepreneurs are now involved in fruit farming in these three districts. And now 44 different types of fruit including mango, banana, jackfruit, papaya, pineapple and oranges are being grown in the hill tracts. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), about 15 per cent of the total fruit produced across the country comes from these three hill tract districts now. Fruits grown on the hills are now available in different districts across the country including Dhaka and Chattogram. Fruit farmers, agriculturists, businessmen and common consumers of these three districts believe, fruit farming in Chittagong Hill Tracts is increasing due to political stability, switching to permanent orchards from Jhum cultivation, with modern agro-technology and marketing becoming easier than before. Besides, as educated and enthusiastic youths have entered this sector, new entrepreneurs have been created too. Even two decades back, fruits were not commercially grown on the hills. The establishment of commercial fruit orchards started mainly from 2004. Gradually, the number of fruit orchards continued to increase. Hilly areas started coming under fruit farming as well."

		"description": "Dhaka once again topped the list of cities around the world with the worst air quality this morning, UNB reports.With an air quality index (AQI) score of 315 at 8:00am on Sunday, Dhaka ranked first in the list of cities with worst air. An AQI between 151 and 200 is said to be ‘unhealthy’ while 201 and 300 is considered ‘very unhealthy’, and 301 to 400 is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. India’s Delhi and China’s Shenyang occupied the second and third spots in the list, with AQI scores of 313 and 245, respectively. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants—Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognised as increasing a person’s chances of developing a heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections and cancer, according to several studies. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections."

Education minister Dipu Moni spoke as the chief guest at the function hosted by the Chinese embassy and Association of Bangladesh-China Alumni (ABCA). Highlighting people to people and cultural relations between the two countries, the education minister said Bangladesh-China friendship and cooperation keeps growing. She said the history of people to people contact between the two countries is much older than that of diplomatic ties. The Chinese New Year is a festival of harmony and cooperation. Harmony is deeply rooted in Chinese heritage. That's why the Chinese people have always valued harmony while maintaining the relations,” said the Chinese ambassador. He said travel to China will be much easier and more flights will be operational from February due to the new policy announced by the Chinese government. ABCA president Munshi Faiz Ahmad and its general secretary professor Md Shahabul Haque, among others, spoke at the function."

		"description": "Although the discourse over the recent visit of the US assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu to Bangladesh has not ended yet, certain things should not go unnoticed. Donald Lu arrived in Bangladesh on a two-day visit on 14 January and held meetings with foreign minister AK Abdul Momen, foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen and members of the civil society.  The US official said he had positive discussions with the government high-ups.  The government side echoed the same. After meeting foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and foreign minister Masud Bin Momen, Donald Lu told newsmen, If you notice the statement of Human Rights Watch, you will see it has admitted the extraordinary progress of RAB in decreasing extrajudicial killings. We also recognise this progress. It is extraordinary. It proves RAB is doing well in protecting human rights by maintaining law and order and tackling terrorism. On 10 December 2021, the US imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and its officials on charges of gross human rights violations.  Referring to the meeting with Donald Lu, home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Donald Lu indicated that the sanctions would be lifted shortly. “We think and hope the sanctions will be removed very soon,” the home minister said. Immediately after the home minister's statement, on 17 January, the US embassy made it clear that US assistant secretary Donald Lu did not indicate any timeframe for revoking the sanctions on Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). During his meetings in Dhaka, assistant secretary Lu did not indicate a timeframe for the removal of RAB sanctions,” said the spokesman for the US mission in Dhaka, Jeff Ridenour, on Tuesday. Soon after the issuance of the US embassy's statement, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir at a press conference on Wednesday said the statement the US embassy issued on Tuesday night is enough to explain the visit of the US assistant secretary Donald Lu to Bangladesh. If we look closely at the statements of the ruling Awami League-led government and the main opposition BNP, it seems both the camps are apparently happy over the recent visit of Donald Lu. "
